Credit for this surge in popularity can be thrown at the feet of Kickstarter and its contemporaries. Some highly publicized projects have raised millions of dollars within a few weeks, transforming idea into reality at lightning speed. These success stories make it easy to forget that projects don't always go as planned. Many flop badly. But how, and why? Kickstarter intentionally makes failure a hard thought to stumble on. Its website does not show failed projects unless they're specifically asked for and the company directs search engine crawlers away from them. Estimating the number of failed projects is difficult because of these tactics, but most independent attempts to pinpoint the figure have landed at 50% or more. What happens to projects that fail? Who is responsible for the 50% that don't make it, and what would they do differently if they tried again? And what about Kickstarters that succeed? Do they deliver, or is it just the beginning of a path full of challenges? To answer these questions I spoke with several different people - one who has experienced success, and two who haven't - to hear the human story behind the facts and figures. The Worst Case Scenario Ethan Mollick's draft of his study The Dynamics Of Crowdfunding: Determinants of Success and Failure is the first academic statistical analysis to be released of a crowd-funding platform. It provided many of the insights that helped inspire this article. One of the most startling facts was about the funding of projects that fail. The mean funding among unsuccessful projects is 10.3% and only one in ten of these projects raise more than 30% of their goal. In other words, most failed projects fail big.

Tyler Carbone, president of SRRN Games, didn't suspect it would be among those statistics when the studio posted its new tower defense project Always Outnumbered to Kickstarter - yet the project found itself barely able to reach 1% of the funding asked. He had reason to think it would be successful. "We'd put out some well-received titles and we'd created a tower defense game before. We were also working with GO Gaming, who were experts in the competitive gaming space." Seeing this avenue open, SRRN threw itself into developing design documentation and concept art - which may have been a mistake. The Always Outnumbered Kickstarter was posted with plenty of detail but without a solid gameplay video. "That would have been the wrong way around for development," according to Tyler, "but it would have made for a more impressive Kickstarter." Most of Tyler's peers shared his initial enthusiasm. Putting together the materials had taken weeks of hard work, but the staff finished it with a feeling of optimism. It didn't take long, however, for the studio to realize that the project wasn't panning out. A few fans pledged, but this slow trickle was nowhere near enough. The developers began to "seriously consider, if not outright assume" that they'd never reach their goal.
