per our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d . mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner & brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression , etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jabper our recent discussions , please evaluate the above gas stream for reconnection into hpl . this gas is presently being produced into dow pipeline . an existing , three - inch meter tube is in place , and the gas can be switched by opening and closing existing valves ? a copy of a recent gas analysis has been provided . the expected gas flow is 9000 to 10 , 000 mcf / d . mr . matt johnson with wagner hence , enhanced production . i would attempt to obtain at least a year ' s commitment of this gas from wagner & brown . mr . johnson did not want to flow this gas for march since the three - inch run could not handle the total volume , and he did not want to split the flow . operational logistics were also questionable ( compression , etc . ) . if you need further info , please advise . thanks . jab
